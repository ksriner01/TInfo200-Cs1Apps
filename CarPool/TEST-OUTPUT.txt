Welcome to the CarPool program! This program will prompt you for information
about your daily commute. You will be asked to input your daily miles driven, the
gas price per gallon in cents, the average miles per gallon of your commute,
your daily parking fees in cents, and your daily toll fees in cents. This information
will then be calculated and outputted to you as the total cost of your daily commute.
Additionally, this program will provide information about and recommend some carpooling
options depending on the total cost of your daily commute.

Please enter the total miles driven per day (ex: 30, 20, etc.): 30
Please enter the cost per gallon of gas in cents (ex: 275, etc.): 275
Please enter the average miles per gallon of your commute (ex: 20, etc.): 20
Please enter the parking fees per day in cents (ex: 1000, etc.): 1000
Please enter the tolls per day in cents (ex: 250, etc.): 250

Based on the information provided, the total cost per day of your
commute is $16.63. The monthly cost of your current commute is $498.75.

To both save money and help reduce your carbon footprint you may consider
looking into some carpool programs in your area. Here are a couple of
common rideshare services that may help you save money:

Comparing the average monthly cost of Vanpool for a 7 day work week to the estimated
monthly cost of your commute you would save $450.05 per month.

At CarpoolWorld, they let you make your own cost-sharing arrangements
and doesn't take a fee from anyone involved. Typically, drivers like to split the cost
of the original commute and therefore you can expect to save around half of your original
cost per day when carpooling with one other person, or $8.31 per day.

Thank you for using the CarPool program.

To both save money and help reduce your carbon footprint you may consider
looking into some carpool programs in your area. Here are a couple of
common rideshare services that may help you save money:

Your current commute currently saves you $18.70 per month over Vanpool's average
monthly fares for a 7 day work week. However, you still may want to think about
carpooling for the environmental benefits it may have within your community.

At CarpoolWorld, they let you make your own cost-sharing arrangements
and doesn't take a fee from anyone involved. Typically, drivers like to split the cost
of the original commute and therefore you can expect to save around half of your original
cost per day when carpooling with one other person, or $0.50 per day.
